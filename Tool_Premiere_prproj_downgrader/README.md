## Description

A simple GUI tool to convert Adobe Premiere Pro CC project file versions.

People always got haunted by newer version of the software, since it produces some project file that the 'even 1 subversion behind' cannot read. PS provides nice solution to it, on contrary Pr Ae and many more do not.

This tool works until Pr reaches version 40. Just need to manually assign if later versions are released or wait for my update.
